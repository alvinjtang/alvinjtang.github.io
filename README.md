## Former chef and neuroscientist, Current full-time Front End Developer

It started with the quadratic formula. At this point, you either know or you don't care. But for me, it's the first function I ever programmed in my TI-83 in Mrs. Smith's 7th grade Algebra class. It's the first time I realized that I can talk to a machine. Soon enough I was programming a multi-platform gaming machine with a junkyard arcade cabinet. In college, I pivoted to the world of medicine, but found myself back in engineering. Implementing design thinking, neuroscience, biotech and gaming to innovate develop cutting-edge therapies for patients with stroke and traumatic brain injury generating data-driven outcomes that resulted in several publications in academic journals and a textbook.

After some years, I decided to take my experience and become a software engineer. I attended Fullstack Academy's immersive software engineering program where I learned the skills listed above and built multiple full stack JavaScript applications (*links below). Afterwards I was selected to continue as a Software Engineering Teaching Fellow, which they offer to each cohort's best students where I mentored new students in the NERD stack, served as project manager for student projects, led stand-ups and code reviews, and conducted algorithmic admissions interviews for prospective students.
